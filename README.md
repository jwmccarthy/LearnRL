## Learning RL
This repo contains code related to my exploration into reinforcement learning. My first project involves implementing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from various sources such as OpenAI's [Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) and [The 37 Implementation Details of PPO](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/) from Huang et al.

## Goal
My ultimate goal is to create an RL-based bot in Rocket League. Several implementations already exist (see [Nexto](https://github.com/Rolv-Arild/Necto)), but I believe improvements can be made to the training methodologies which ultimately lead to a stronger, more human-like playstyle. I hypothesize that more advanced imitation learning techniques could be the key to imprinting human-level play on an RL Rocket League bot. I'm learning RL from the ground up, so this end project in mind will help to focus my studies to specific areas and motivate me to learn!
