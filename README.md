## Learning RL
This repo contains code related to my exploration into reinforcement learning. My first project involves implementing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from various sources such as OpenAI's [Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) and [The 37 Implementation Details of PPO](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/) from Huang et al.
